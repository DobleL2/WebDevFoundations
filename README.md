## HTML Basics

### HTML Structure

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It uses a series of elements, represented by tags, to structure content on the web.

### Common Tags

- <html>: The root element of an HTML page.
- <head>: Contains meta-information about the document.
- <body>: The main content of the HTML document.
- <h1> to <h6>: Heading tags.
- <p>: Paragraph tag.
- <a>: Anchor tag for hyperlinks.
- <img>: Image tag.
- <div> and <span>: Division and span tags for organizing content.

## CSS Basics

### CSS Syntax

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. It controls the appearance of HTML elements by applying styles to them.

### Selectors and Properties

- Selectors: Target HTML elements (e.g., p, h1, .class-name, #id).
- Properties: Define the style (e.g., color, font-size, margin).

Example:

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
}
